# high places #

## Definition: ##

The term "high places" refers to the altars and shrines that were used for worshiping idols. They were usually built on higher ground, such as on a hill or mountainside.

* Many of the kings of Israel sinned against God by building altars to false gods on these high places. This led the people to become deeply involved in worshiping idols.
* When a God-fearing king started ruling in Israel or Judah, often he would remove the high places or altars in order to stop the worship of these idols.
* However, some of these good kings were careless and did not remove the high places, which resulted in the entire nation of Israel continuing to worship idols.

## Translation Suggestions: ##

* Other ways to translate this term could include, "elevated places for idol worship" or "hilltop idol shrines" or "idol altar mounds."
* Make sure it is clear that this term refers to the idol altars, not just to the high place where those altars are located.
