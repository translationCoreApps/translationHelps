* In New Testament times, the capital of Phoenicia was Tyre. Another important Phoenician city was Sidon.
* Phoenicians were well-known for their woodworking skills using their country's plentiful cedar trees, for their production of a costly purple dye, and for their ability to travel and trade by sea. They were also highly-skilled boat builders.
* One of the earliest alphabets was created by the Phoenician people. Their alphabet was widely used because of their contact with many people groups through trading.
