# head #

## Definition: ##

In the Bible, the word "head" is used with several figurative meanings.

* Often this term is used to refer to being in authority over people, as in, "you have made me the head over nations." This could be translated as, "You have made me the ruler…" or "You have given me authority over…"
* Jesus is called the "head of the church." Just as a person's head guides and directs the members of its body, so Jesus guides and directs the members of his "body," the Church.
* The New Testament teaches that a husband is the "head" or authority of his wife. He is given the responsibility of leading and guiding his wife and family.
* The expression, "no razor will ever touch his head" means " he will never cut or shave his hair."
* The term "head" can also refer to the beginning or source of something as in the "head of the street."
* The expression "heads of grain" refers to the top part of a wheat or barley plant that contains the seeds.
* Another figurative use for "head" is when it is used to represent the whole person as in, "this gray head" referring to an elderly person or "the head of Joseph" referring to Joseph. (See: [synecdoche](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-ta-translate-vol2/src/master/content/figs_synecdoche.md))
* The expression "let their blood be on his own head" means that the man is responsible for their deaths and will receive the punishment for that.

## Translation Suggestions ##

* Depending on the context, the term "head" could be translated as, "authority" or "the one who leads and directs" or "the one who is responsible for."
* The expression "head of" can refer to the whole person and so this expression could be translated using just the person's name. For example, "the head of Joseph" could simply be translated as "Joseph."
* The expression "will be on his own head" could be translated as "will be on him" or "he will be punished for" or "he will be held responsible for" or "he will be considered guilty for."
* Depending on the context, other ways to translate this term could include, "beginning" or "source" or "ruler" or "leader" or "top."
