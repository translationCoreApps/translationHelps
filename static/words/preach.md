# preach #

## Definition: ##

To speak to a group of people, teaching them about God and urging them to obey him.

 * Often preaching is done by one person to a large group of people. It is usually spoken, not written.
 * "Preaching" and "teaching" are similar, but are not exactly the same.
 * "Preaching" mainly refers to publicly proclaiming spiritual or moral truth, and urging the audience to respond. "Teaching" is a term that emphasizes instruction, that is, giving people information or teaching them how to do something.
 * The term "preach" is usually used with the word "gospel."
 * What a person has preached to others can also be referred to in general as his "teachings."
