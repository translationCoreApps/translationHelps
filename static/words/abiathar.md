## Definition: ##

Abiathar was a high priest for the nation of Israel during the time of King David.

* When King Saul killed the priests, Abiathar escaped and went to David in the wilderness.
* Abiathar and another high priest named Zadok served David faithfully throughout his reign.
* After David's death, Abiathar helped Adonijah try to become king instead of Solomon. 
* Because of this, King Solomon removed Abiathar from the priesthood.
