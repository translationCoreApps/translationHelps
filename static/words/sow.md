# sow, sower, plant #

## Definition: ##

To "sow" means to put seeds in the ground in order to grow plants. A "sower" is a person who sows or plants seeds.

* The method of sowing or planting varies, but one method is to take handfuls of seeds and scatter them on the ground.
* Another method for planting seeds is to make holes in the soil and place seeds in each hole.
* The term "sow" can be used figuratively as in, "a person will reap what he sows." This means that if a person does something evil, he will receive a negative result. And if a person does good to others, he will receive a positive result.
