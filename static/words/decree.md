# decree #

## Definition: ##

A decree is a proclamation or law that is publicly declared to all the people.

* God's laws are also called decrees, statutes, or commandments.
* Like laws and commands, decrees  must be obeyed.
* An example of a decree by a human ruler was the proclamation by Caesar Augustus that everyone living in the Roman Empire must go back to their hometown in order to be counted in a census.
* To decree something means to give an order that must be obeyed. This could be translated as, "to order" or "to command" or "to formally require" or "to publicly make a law."
* Something that is "decreed" to happen means that this "will definitely happen" or "has been decided upon and will not be changed" or "declared absolutely that this will happen."
