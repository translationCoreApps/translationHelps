# tribe #

## Definition: ##

A tribe is a group of people who are descended from a common ancestor. 

* People from the same tribe usually also share a common language and culture.
* In the Old Testament, God divided the people of Israel into twelve tribes. Each tribe was descended from a son or grandson of Jacob.
* A tribe is smaller than a nation, but larger than a clan.
