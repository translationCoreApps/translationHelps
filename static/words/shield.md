# shield #

## Definition: ##

A shield is an object held by a soldier in battle to protect himself from being injured by the enemy's weapons. "To shield" someone means to protect that person from harm.

* Shields were often circular or oval in shape and were made of materials such as leather, wood, or metal that were sturdy and thick enough to keep a sword or arrow from piercing them.
* Using this term as a metaphor, the Bible refers to God as a protective shield for his people. (See: [Metaphor](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-ta-translate-vol1/src/master/content/figs_metaphor.md))
* Paul also talks about the "shield of faith," which is a figurative way of saying that believing in Jesus, and living out that faith in obedience to God, will protect believers from spiritual attacks from Satan.
