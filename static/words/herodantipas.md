# Herod Antipas #

## Facts: ##

 During most of Jesus' lifetime, Herod Antipas was the ruler of the part of the Roman Empire that included Galilee province. 

* Like his father Herod the Great, Antipas was sometimes referred to as "King Herod" even though he was not really a king.
* Herod Antipas ruled one-fourth of the Roman Empire and so he was also called "Herod the tetrarch."
* Antipas is the "Herod" who gave the order for John the Baptist to be killed by beheading.
* It was also Herod Antipas who questioned Jesus before his crucifixion.
* The other Herods in the New Testament were Antipas' son (Agrippa) and grandson (Agrippa 2) who ruled during the time of the apostles.
