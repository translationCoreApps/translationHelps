# Moses #

## Facts: ##

Moses was a prophet and leader of the Israelite people for over 40 years.  

 * When Moses was a baby, Moses' parents put him in a basket in the reeds of the Nile River to hide him from the Egyptian Pharaoh. Moses' sister Miriam watched over him there. Moses' life was spared when the pharaoh's daughter found him and took him to the palace to raise him as her son.
 * God chose Moses to free the Israelites from slavery in Egypt and to lead them to the Promised Land.
 * After the Israelites' escape from Egypt and while they were wandering in the desert, God gave Moses two stone tablets with the Ten Commandments written on them.
 * Near the end of his life, Moses saw the Promised Land, but didn't get to live in it because he disobeyed God.
