## Facts: ##

Paul was a leader of the early church who was sent by Jesus to take the good news to many other people groups.

 * Paul was a Jew who was born in the Roman city of Tarsus, and was therefore also a Roman citizen.
 * Paul was originally called by his Jewish name, Saul.
 * Saul became a Jewish religious leader and arrested Jews who became Christians because he thought they were dishonoring God by believing in Jesus.
 * Jesus revealed himself to Saul in a blinding light and told him to stop hurting Christians.
 * Saul believed in Jesus and began teaching his fellow Jews about him.
 * Later, God sent Saul to teach nonJewish people about Jesus and started churches in different cities and provinces of the Roman empire. At this time he started being called by the Roman name "Paul."
 * Paul also wrote letters to encourage and teach Christians in the churches in these cities. Several of these letters are in the New Testament.
