# lampstand #

## Definition: ##

In the Bible, the term "lampstand" generally refers to a structure on which a lamp is placed in order to provide light to a room.

* A simple lampstand usually held one lamp and was made of clay, wood, or metal (such as bronze, silver, or gold.)
* In the Jerusalem temple was a special gold lampstand which had seven branches for holding seven lamps.

## Translation Suggestions ##

* This term could be also translated as, "lamp pedestal" or "structure for holding a lamp" or "lamp holder."
* For the temple lampstand, this could be translated as, "seven-lamp lampstand" or "gold pedestal with seven lamps."
* It would also be helpful in a translation to include pictures of a simple lampstand and a seven-branch lampstand in the relevant Bible passages.
