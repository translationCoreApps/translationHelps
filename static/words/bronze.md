## Definition: ##

The term "bronze" refers to a kind of metal that is made from melting together the metals, copper and tin. It has a dark brown color, slightly red.

* Bronze resists water corrosion and is a good conductor of heat.
* In ancient times, bronze was used for making tools, weapons, artwork, altars, cooking pots, and soldiers' armor, among other things.
* Many building materials for the tabernacle and temple were made of bronze.
* Idols of false gods were also often made of bronze metal.
* Bronze objects were made by first melting the bronze metal into a liquid and then pouring it into molds. This process was called "casting."
