# fire #

## Definition: ##

Fire is the heat, light, and flames that are produced when something is burned.

* Burning wood by fire turns the wood into ashes.
* The term "fire" is also used figuratively, usually referring to judgment or purification.
* The final judgment of unbelievers is in the fire of hell.
* Fire is used to refine gold and other metals. In the Bible, this process is used to explain how God refines people through difficult things that happen in their lives.
* The phrase "baptize with fire" could also be translated as, "cause you to experience suffering in order to purify you."
