# snare, trap #

## Definition: ##

The terms "snare" and "trap" refer to devices that are used to catch animals and keep them from escaping. In the Bible, these terms are also used figuratively to talk about how sin and temptation are like hidden traps that catch people and harm them.

* A "snare" has a loop of rope or wire that suddenly pulls tight when an animal steps into it, ensnaring its leg.
* A "trap" usually made of metal or wood and has two parts that suddenly and powerfully close together in order to catch an animal so it can't get away. Sometimes a trap can be a deep hole that has been made in order to get something to fall into it.
* Usually the snare or trap is hidden so that its prey is taken by surprise. 
* The phrase "set a trap" means to get a trap ready to capture something.
* To "fall into a trap" refers to falling into a deep hole or pit that was dug and hidden in order to catch an animal.
* When used figuratively, being caught in a trap or snare is compared to how a person can suddenly become ensnared in a sin in the same way that an animal gets captured by a physical snare or trap.
* Just as an animal is endangered and hurt by being in a trap, so a person caught in the trap of sin is being harmed by that sin and needs to be set free.
