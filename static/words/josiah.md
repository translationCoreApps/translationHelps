## Facts: ##

Josiah was a godly king who reigned over the kingdom of Judah for thirty-one years. He led the people of Judah to repent and worship Yahweh.

* After his father King Amon was killed, Josiah became king over Judah at eight years of age.
* In the eighteenth year of his reign, King Josiah ordered Hilkiah the high priest to rebuild the temple of the Lord. While this was being done, the books of the Law were found.
* When the books of the Law were read to Josiah, he was grieved at how his people were disobeying God. He ordered that all the places of idol worship be destroyed and that the priests of the false gods be killed.
* He also ordered the people to start celebrating the Passover feast again.
