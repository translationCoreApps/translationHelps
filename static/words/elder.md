* In the Old Testament, the elders helped lead the Israelites in matters of social justice and the Law of Moses.
* In the New Testament, Jewish elders continued to be leaders in their communities and also were judges for the people.
* In the early Christian churches, Christian elders gave spiritual leadership to the local assemblies of believers.
