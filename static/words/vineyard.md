# vineyard #

## Definition: ##

A vineyard is a large garden area where grapevines are grown and grapes are cultivated.

 * A vineyard often has a wall around it to protect the fruit from thieves and animals.
 * God compared the people of Israel to a vineyard that did not bear good fruit. (See: [Metaphor](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-ta-translate-vol1/src/master/content/figs_metaphor.md))
 * Vineyard could be also translated as, "grapevine garden" or "grape plantation."
