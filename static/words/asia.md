# Asia #

## Facts: ##

In Bible times, "Asia" was the name of a province of the Roman Empire. It was located in the western part of what is now the country of Turkey.

* Paul traveled to Asia and shared the gospel in several cities there. Among these were the cities of Ephesus and Colossae. 
* To avoid confusion with modern day Asia, it may be necessary to translate this as, "the ancient Roman province called Asia" or "Asia Province."
* All of the churches referenced in Revelation were in the Roman province of Asia.
