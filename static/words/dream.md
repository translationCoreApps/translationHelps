# dream #

## Definition: ##

A dream is something that people see or experience in their minds while they are sleeping.

 * Dreams often seem like they are really happening, but they are not.
 * Sometimes God causes people to dream about something so they can learn from it. He may also speak directly to people in their dreams.
 * In the Bible, God gave special dreams to certain people to give them a message, often about something that would happen in the future.
 * A dream is different from a vision. Dreams happen while a person is asleep, but visions usually happen when a person is awake.
