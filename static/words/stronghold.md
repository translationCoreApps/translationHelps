# stronghold, fortress, fortified #

## Definition: ##

The terms "stronghold" and "fortress" both refer to places that are well protected against an attack by enemy soldiers. The term "fortified" describes a city or other place that has been made safe from attack.

* Often, strongholds and fortresses are manmade structures with defensive walls. They can also be natural protective barriers such as rocky cliffs or high mountains.
* People fortify strongholds by building thick walls or other structures that make it difficult for an enemy to break through.
* "Stronghold" or "fortress" could be translated as "securely strong place" or "strongly protected place."
* The term "fortified city" could be translated as "securely protected city" or "strongly built city."
* This term is also used figuratively to refer to God as a stronghold or fortress for those who trust in him. (See: [Metaphor](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-ta-translate-vol1/src/master/content/figs_metaphor.md))
* Another figurative meaning for the term "stronghold" refers to something that someone wrongly trusts in for security, such as a false god or other thing that is worshiped instead of Yahweh. This could be translated as, "false strongholds."
* This term should be translated differently from "refuge," which emphasizes safety more than the concept of being fortified.
