## Definition: ##

The terms "tax" and "taxes" refer to money or goods that people pay to a government that is in authority over them.

* The amount of money that is paid for tax is usually based on the value of an item or on how much a person's property is worth.
* If taxes are not paid, the government can take legal action against a person to get the money that is owed.
* Joseph and Mary traveled to Bethlehem to be counted in the census that was for the purpose of taxing everyone living in the Roman empire.
* There was also a "temple tax" which was money that people put in the temple offering box. Some of this money was used for taking care of the temple building.
* The term "tax" could also be translated as, "required payment" or "government money" or "temple money," depending on the context.
* Phrases such as, "collect taxes" and "pay taxes" could also be translated as, "pay money to the government" or "receive money for the government" or "make the required payment."
* A "tax collector" is someone who works for the government to receive the money that people are required to pay them.
