# Asherah, Asherah poles, Ashtoreth #

## Definition: ##

Asherah was the name of a goddess that was worshiped by Canaanite people groups during Old Testament times. "Ashtoreth" may be another name for "Asherah," or it could be the name of a different goddess that was very similar.

* The term "Asherah poles" refers to carved wooden images or carved trees that were made to represent this goddess.
* Asherah poles were often set up near altars of the false god Baal, who was thought of as Asherah's husband. Some people groups worshiped Baal as the sun god and Asherah or Ashtoreth as the moon goddess.
* God commanded the Israelites to destroy all the carved images of Asherah.
* Some Israelite leaders such as Gideon, King Asa, and King Josiah obeyed God and led the people in destroying these idols.
* But other Israelite leaders such as King Solomon, King Manasseh, and King Ahab did not get rid of the Asherah poles and influenced the people to worship these idols.
