# Golgotha #

## Facts: ##

The term "Golgotha" is the name of the place where Jesus was crucified. It comes from an Aramaic word that means, "Skull" or "Place of the Skull."

* Golgotha was located outside the city walls of Jerusalem, somewhere nearby. It was perhaps located on a slope of the Mount of Olives.
* In some older English versions of the Bible, Golgotha is translated as "Calvary," which comes from the Latin word for "skull." 
* Many Bible versions use a word that looks or sounds similar to "Golgotha," since its meaning is already explained in the Bible text. Also see the link below about how to translate names in the Bible.
