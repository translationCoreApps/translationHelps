# honey, honeycomb #

## Definition: ##

Honey is the sweet, sticky, edible substance that honeybees make out of flower nectar. Honeycomb is the waxy frame where the bees store honey.

* Depending on the kind, honey can be yellowish or brownish in color.
* Honey can be found in the wild, such as in the hollow of a tree, or wherever the bees make a nest. People also raise bees in hives in order to produce honey to eat or sell, but probably the honey mentioned in the Bible was wild honey.
* Three people that the Bible specifically mentions as eating wild honey were Jonathan, Samson, and John the Baptist.
* This term is often used figuratively to describe something that is sweet or very pleasurable. For example, God's words and decrees are said to be "sweeter than honey."

* Sometimes a person's words are described as seeming sweet like honey, but instead result in deceiving and harming others.
