Jezebel was the wicked wife of King Ahab of Israel.

* Jezebel influenced Ahab and the rest of Israel to worship idols.
* She also killed many of God's prophets.
* Jezebel caused an innocent man named Naboth to be killed so that Ahab could steal Naboth's vineyard.
* Jezebel was finally killed due to all the evil things she had done. Elijah prophesied about how she would die and it happened exactly as he had predicted.
