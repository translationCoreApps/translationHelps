# lute, lyre #

## Definition: ##

The lute and the lyre are small, stringed, musical instruments that were used by the Israelites to worship God.

* A lyre looks like a small harp, with an open frame that the strings are strung across.
* A lute is very similar to a modern day acoustic guitar, having a wooden sound box and an extended neck on which the strings are strung.
* To play a lute or a lyre, certain strings are held down with the fingers of one hand while other strings are plucked or strummed with the other hand.
* The lute, lyre, and harp are all played by strumming or plucking the strings.
* The number of strings varied, but the Old Testament specifically mentions instruments that had ten strings.
