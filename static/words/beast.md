## Facts: ##

In the Bible, the term "beast" is often just another way of saying "animal."

* A wild beast is a type of animal that lives freely in the forest or fields and has not been trained by people.
* A domestic beast is an animal that lives with people and is kept for food or for performing work, such as plowing fields. Often the term "livestock" is used to refer to this kind of animal.
* The Old Testament book of Daniel and the New Testament book of Revelation describe visions which have beasts that represent evil powers and authorities that oppose God.  (See: [Metaphor](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-ta-translate-vol1/src/master/content/figs_metaphor.md))
* Some of these beasts are described as having strange features, such as several heads and many horns. They often have power and authority, indicating that they may represent countries, nations, or other political powers.
* Ways to translate this could include, "creature" or "created thing" or "animal" or "wild animal," depending on the context.
