# Horeb #

## Definition: ##

Mount Horeb is another name for Mount Sinai, where God gave Moses the stone tablets with the ten commandments.

* Mount Horeb is called the "mountain of God."
* Horeb was the place where Moses saw the burning bush when he was tending sheep.
* Mount Horeb was the place where God revealed his covenant to the Israelites by giving them the stone tablets with his commandments written on them.
* It was also the place where God later told Moses to strike a rock to provide water for the Israelites as they were wandering in the desert.
* The exact location of this mountain is not known, but it may  have been in the southern part of what is now the Sinai Peninsula.
* It is possible that "Horeb" was the actual name of the mountain and that "Mount Sinai" simply means "mountain of Sinai," referring to the fact that Mount Horeb was located in the desert of Sinai.
