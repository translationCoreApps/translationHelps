# sacrifice, offering #

## Definition: ##

In the Bible, the terms "sacrifice" and "offering" refer to special gifts given to God as an act of worshiping him. People also offered sacrifices to false gods.

* The word "offering" generally refers to anything that is offered or given. The term "sacrifice" refers to something that is given or done at great cost to the giver.
* Offerings to God were specific things that he commanded the Israelites to give in order to express devotion and obedience to him.
* The names of the different offerings, such as "burnt offering" and "peace offering," indicated what kind of offering was being given.
* Sacrifices to God often involved the killing of an animal.
* Only the sacrifice of Jesus, God's perfect, sinless Son, can completely cleanse people from sin. Animal sacrifices could never do that.
* The figurative expression "offer yourselves as a living sacrifice" means, "live your life in complete obedience to God, giving up everything in order to serve him."
