# conscience #

## Definition: ##

The conscience is the part of a person's thinking through which God makes him aware that he is doing something sinful.

* God gave people a conscience to help them know the difference between what is right and what is wrong.
* A person who obeys God is said to have a "pure" or "clear" or "clean" conscience.
* If a person has a "clear conscience" it means that he is not hiding any sin.
* If someone ignores their conscience and no longer feels guilty when he sins, this means his conscience is no longer sensitive to what is wrong. The Bible calls this a "seared" conscience, one that is "branded" as if with a hot iron. Such a conscience is also called "insensitive" and "polluted."
* Possible ways to translate this term could include, "inner moral guide" or "moral thinking."
