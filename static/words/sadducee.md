# Sadducee #

## Definition: ##

The Sadducees were a political group of Jewish priests during the time of Jesus Christ who supported Roman rule and who did not believe in the resurrection.

* ​Many Sadducees were wealthy, upper class Jews who held powerful leadership positions such as chief priest and high priest.
* The duties of the Sadducees included taking care of the temple complex and priestly tasks such as offering sacrifices.
* The Sadducees and the Pharisees strongly influenced the Roman leaders to crucify Jesus.
* Jesus spoke against these two religious groups because of their selfishness and hypocrisy.
