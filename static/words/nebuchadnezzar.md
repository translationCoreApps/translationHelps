# Nebuchadnezzar #

## Facts: ##

Nebuchadnezzar was a king of the Babylonian Empire whose powerful army conquered many people groups and nations.

* Under Nebuchadnezzar's leadership, the Babylonian army attacked and conquered the kingdom of Judah, and took most of the people of Judah to Babylon as captives. This "Babylonian Exile" lasted 70 years.
* One of the exiles, Daniel, interpreted dreams that King Nebuchadnezzar had.
* Three other captured Israelites, Hananiah, Meshael, and Azariah, were thrown into a fiery furnace when they refused to bow down to a gigantic gold statue that Nebuchadnezzar had made.
* King Nebuchadnezzar was very arrogant and worshiped false gods. When he conquered Judah, he stole many gold and silver objects from the temple in Jerusalem.
* Because Nebuchadnezzar was proud and refused to turn away from worshiping false gods, Yahweh caused him to be destitute for seven years, living like an animal. After the seven years, God restored Nebuchadnezzar when he humbled himself and praised the one true God, Yahweh.
