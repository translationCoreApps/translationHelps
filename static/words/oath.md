## Definition: ##

In the Bible, an oath is a formal promise to do something. The person making the oath is required to fulfill that promise. An oath involves a commitment to being faithful and truthful.

* Often in a court of law, a witness gives an oath to promise that whatever he says will be true and factual.
* In the Bible, the term "swear" means to speak an oath.
* The term "swear by" means to use the name of something or someone as the basis or power on which the oath is made.
* Sometimes these terms are used together as in, "swear an oath."
* Abraham and Abimelech swore an oath when they made a covenant together concerning the use of a well.
* Abraham told his servant to swear (formally promise) that he would find Isaac a wife from among Abraham's relatives.
* God also made oaths in which he made promises to his people.

## Translation Suggestions: ##
