# oath, swear, swear by #

## Definition: ##

In the Bible, an oath is a formal promise to do something. The person making the oath is required to fulfill that promise. An oath involves a commitment to being faithful and truthful.

* Often in a court of law, a witness gives an oath to promise that whatever he says will be true and factual.
* In the Bible, the term "swear" means to speak an oath.
* The term "swear by" means to use the name of something or someone as the basis or power on which the oath is made.
* Sometimes these terms are used together as in, "swear an oath."
* Abraham and Abimelech swore an oath when they made a covenant together concerning the use of a well.
* Abraham told his servant to swear (formally promise) that he would find Isaac a wife from among Abraham's relatives.
* God also made oaths in which he made promises to his people.
* A modern-day use of the word "swear" means to use foul language. This is not its meaning in the Bible.

## Translation Suggestions: ##

* Depending on the context, "an oath" could also be translated as "a pledge" or "a solemn promise."
* "To swear" could be translated by "to formally promise" or "to pledge" or "to commit to do something."
* Other ways to translate "swear by my name" could include, "make a promise using my name to confirm it."
* To "swear by heaven and earth" could be translated as, "promise to do something, stating that heaven and earth will confirm it."
* Make sure the translation of "swear" or "oath" does not refer to cursing. In the Bible it does not have that meaning.
