## Definition: ##

The term "incense" refers to a mixture of fragrant spices that are burned to produce smoke that has a pleasant smell. 

 * God told the Israelites to burn incense as an offering to him.
 * The incense had to be made from mixing equal amounts of five specific spices exactly as God directed. This was a sacred incense, so they were not allowed to use it for any other purpose.
 * The "altar of incense" was a special altar that was only used for burning incense.
 * The incense was offered at least four times a day, at each hour of prayer. It was also offered every time a burnt offering was made.
 * The burning of incense represents prayer and worship rising up to God from his people.
 * Other ways to translate "incense" could include, "fragrant spices" or "good-smelling plants."
