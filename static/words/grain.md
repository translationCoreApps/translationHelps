The term "grain" usually refers to the seed of a food plant such as wheat, barley, corn, millet, or rice. It can also refer to the whole plant.

* In the Bible, the main grains that are referred to are wheat and barley.
* The heads of grain are the part of the plant that holds the grain.
* Note that some older Bible versions use the word "corn" to refer to grain in general. In modern English however, "corn" only refers to one type of grain.
