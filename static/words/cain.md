# Cain #

## Facts: ##

Cain and his younger brother Abel were the first sons of Adam and Eve mentioned in the Bible.

* Cain was a farmer who produced food crops while Abel was a sheep herder.
* Cain killed his brother Abel in a fit of jealousy, because God had accepted Abel's sacrifice, but had not accepted Cain's sacrifice.
* As punishment, God sent him away from Eden and told him that the land would no longer yield crops for him.
* God put a mark on Cain's forehead as a sign that God would protect him from being killed by other people as he wandered.
