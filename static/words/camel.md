* In Bible times, the camel was the largest animal found in Israel and the surrounding regions.
* The camel was used mainly for carrying people and burdens.
* Some people groups also used camels for food, but not the Israelites because God had said that camels were unclean and were not to be eaten.
* Camels were valuable because they could move swiftly in the sand and could live without food and water for several weeks at a time.
