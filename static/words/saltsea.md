# Salt Sea, Dead Sea #

## Facts: ##

The Salt Sea (also called the Dead Sea) was located between southern Israel on the west and Moab on the east.

* The Jordan River flows south into the Salt Sea.
* Because it is smaller than most seas, this could be called "Salt Lake."
* This sea has a high concentration of minerals (or "salts") which means that nothing can live in its waters. That is where the name "Dead Sea" came from.
* In the Old Testament, this sea is also called the "Sea of Arabah" and the "Sea of Negev" because of its locations near the regions of Arabah and Negev.
