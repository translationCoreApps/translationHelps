# labor pains, in labor #

## Definition: ##

A woman who is "in labor" is experiencing the pains that lead up to the birth of her child. These are called "labor pains."

* In his letter to the Galatians, the apostle Paul used this term figuratively to describe his own intense striving to help his fellow believers become more and more like Christ.
* The analogy of labor pains is also used in the Bible to describe how disasters in the last days will happen with increasing frequency and intensity.
