# famine #

## Definition: ##

The term "famine" refers to an extreme lack of food throughout a country or region, usually due to not enough rain.

* Food crops can fail from natural causes such as lack of rain, crop disease, or insects.
* Food shortages can also be caused by people, such as enemies destroying crops.
* In the Bible, God often caused famine as a way to punish nations when they sinned against him.
* In Amos 8:11 the term "famine" is used figuratively to refer to a time when God punished his people by not speaking to them. This could be translated with the word for "famine" in your language, or with a phrase such as, "extreme lack" or "severe deprivation."
