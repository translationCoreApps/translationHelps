# neighbor #

## Definition: ##

The term "neighbor" usually refers to a person who lives nearby. It can also refer more generally to someone who lives in the same community or people group.

* A "neighbor" is someone who would be protected and treated kindly because he is part of the same community.
* In the New Testament parable of the Good Samaritan, Jesus used the term "neighbor" figuratively, expanding its meaning to include all human beings, even someone who is considered an enemy.
* If possible, it is best to translate this term literally with a word or phrase that means "person who lives nearby."
