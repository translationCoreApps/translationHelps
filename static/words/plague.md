## Definition: ##

Plagues are events which cause suffering or death to a large number of people. Often a plague is a disease that spreads quickly and causes many people to die before it can be stopped.

* Many plagues have natural causes, but some were sent by God to punish people for sin.
* In the time of Moses, God sent ten plagues against Egypt to force Pharaoh to let Israel leave Egypt. These plagues included water turning into blood, physical diseases, destruction of crops by insects and hail, three days of complete darkness, and death of the firstborn sons.
* This could also be translated as, "widespread disasters" or "widespread disease," depending on the context.
