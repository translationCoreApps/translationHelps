# scroll #

## Definition: ##

In ancient times, a scroll was a type of book made of one long, rolled-up sheet of papyrus or leather.

* After writing on a scroll or reading it, people rolled it up using rods on the ends.
* Scrolls were used for legal documents and scripture.
* Sometimes scrolls that were delivered by a messenger were sealed with wax. This would prevent anyone else from opening the scroll and writing on it.
* Scrolls containing the Hebrew Scriptures were read aloud in the synagogues.
