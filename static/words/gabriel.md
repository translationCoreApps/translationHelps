## Facts: ##

Gabriel is the name of one of God's angels. He is mentioned by name several times, in both the Old and New Testaments.

 * God sent Gabriel to tell the prophet Daniel the meaning of a vision he had seen.
 * Another time, while Daniel was praying, the angel Gabriel flew to him and prophesied about what would happen in the future. Daniel described him as a "man."
 * In the New Testament it is recorded that Gabriel came to Zechariah to prophesy that his aged wife Elizabeth would have a son, John.
 * Sixth months after that, Gabriel was sent to Mary to tell her that God would miraculously enable her to conceive a child who would be the "Son of God." Gabriel told Mary to name her son, "Jesus."
