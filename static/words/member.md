# member #

## Definition: ##

The term "member" refers to one part of a complex body or group.

* The New Testament describes Christians as "members" of the Body of Christ. Believers in Christ belong to a group that is made up of many members. 
* Jesus Christ is the "head" of the Body and individual believers function as the members of the body. The Holy Spirit gives each member of the body a special role to help the entire body to function well.
* Individuals who participate in groups such as the Jewish Council and the Pharisees are also called "members" of these groups.
