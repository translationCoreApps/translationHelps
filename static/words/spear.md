# spear #

## Definition: ##

A spear is a weapon with a long wooden handle and sharp metal blade on one end that is thrown a long distance.

* Spears were commonly used for war in biblical times. They are sometimes still used in present-day conflicts between certain people groups.
* A spear was used by a Roman soldier to pierce the side of Jesus while he hung on the cross.
* Sometimes people throw spears to catch fish or other prey to eat.
* Similar weapons are the "javelin" or "lance."
* Make sure that the translation of "spear" is different from the translation of "sword," which is a weapon that is used for thrusting or stabbing, not throwing. Also, a sword has a long blade with a handle, while a spear has a small blade on the end of a long shaft.
