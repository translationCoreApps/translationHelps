# Hades, Sheol #

## Definition: ##

The terms "Hades" and "Sheol" are used in the Bible to refer to death and the place where the souls of people go when they die. Their meanings are similar.

* The Hebrew term "Sheol" is often used in the Old Testament to refer generally to the place of death. 
* In the New Testament, the Greek term "Hades" refers to a place for the souls of people who rebelled against God. These souls are referred to as going "down" to Hades. This is sometimes contrasted to going "up" to heaven, where the souls of people who believe in Jesus live.
* The term "Hades" is coupled with the term "death" in the book of Revelation. In the end times, both death and Hades will be thrown into the Lake of Fire, which is hell.
