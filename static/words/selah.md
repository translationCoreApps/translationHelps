# selah #

## Definition: ##

The term "selah" is a Hebrew word that occurs mostly in the book of Psalms. It has several possible meanings.

* It could mean "pause and praise," which would invite the audience to think carefully about what was just said.
* Since many of the Psalms were written as songs, it is thought that "selah" may have been a musical term to instruct the singer to pause in his singing to allow for the musical instruments to play alone or to encourage listeners to think about the words of the song.
