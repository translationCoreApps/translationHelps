* This literal meaning could also be used in a figurative context, if it communicates the correct meaning in that context.
* For figurative uses where the literal meaning would not make sense in the project language, "stumble" could be translated as, "sin" or "falter" or "stop believing" or "become weak," depending [sin](../kt/sin.md)on the context.
* Another way to translate this term could be, "stumble by sinning" or "stumble by not believing."
