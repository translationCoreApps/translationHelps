# stiff-necked, stubborn #

## Definition: ##

The term "stiff-necked" is an idiom used in the Bible to describe people who keep disobeying God and refuse to repent. They are very proud and will not submit to God's authority.

* Similarly, the term "stubborn" means to refuse to change one's mind or actions even when urged to do so. Stubborn people will not listen to good advice or warnings that other people give them.
* The Old Testament described the Israelites as "stiff-necked" because they did not listen to the many messages from God's prophets who urged them to repent and turn back to Yahweh.
* If a neck is "stiff" it means that it does not bend easily. The project language may have a different idiom that communicates that a person is "unbending" that is, refusing to change his ways. 
* Other ways to translate this term could include, "pridefully stubborn" or "arrogant and unyielding" or "refusing to change."
