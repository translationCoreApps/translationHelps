# Naaman #

## Facts: ##

In the Old Testament, Naaman was the commander of the army of the king of Aram. 

* Naaman had a terrible skin disease called leprosy that could not be cured.
* A Jewish slave in Naaman's household told him to go ask the prophet Elisha to heal him.
* Elisha told Naaman to wash seven times in the Jordan River. When Naaman obeyed, God healed him of his disease.
* As a result, Naaman came to believe in the only true God, Yahweh.
* Two other men named Naaman were descendants of Jacob's son Benjamin.
