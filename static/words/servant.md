# servant, slave, slavery #

## Definition: ##

The word for "servant" can also mean "slave" and refers to a person who works for another person, either by choice or by force. The surrounding text usually makes it clear whether a servant or a slave is being referred to.

* In Bible times, there was less of a difference between a servant and a slave than there is today. Both servants and slaves were an important part of their master's household and many were treated almost like members of the family. Sometimes a servant would choose to become a lifetime servant to his master.
* A slave is a kind of servant who is the property of the person he works for. The person who buys a slave is called his "owner" or "master." Some masters treat their slaves very cruelly, while other masters treat their slaves very well, like a servant who is a valued member of the household.
* In ancient times, some people willingly became slaves to a person they owed money to in order to pay off their debt to that person. 
* In the Bible, the phrase "I am your servant" was used as a sign of respect and service to a person of higher rank, such as a king. It does not mean that the person speaking was an actual servant.
* In the Old Testament, God's prophets and other people who worshiped God are often referred to as his "servants."
* In the New Testament, people who obey God through faith in Christ are often called his "servants."
* Christians are also called "slaves to righteousness," which is a metaphor that compares the commitment to obey God to a slave's commitment to obeying his master. (See: [Metaphor](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-ta-translate-vol1/src/master/content/figs_metaphor.md))
