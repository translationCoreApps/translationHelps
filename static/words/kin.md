# kin, kinsman #

## Definition: ##

The term "kin" refers to a person's blood relative. The word "kinsman" refers specifically to a male relative.

* These terms can refer to a close relative, such as a parent or brother, or to a more distant relative, such as an aunt, uncle, or cousin.
* In ancient Israel, if a man died, his nearest male relative was expected to marry his widow, manage his property, and help carry on his family name. This relative was called a "kinsman-redeemer."
* This term could also be translated as, "relative" or "family member."
