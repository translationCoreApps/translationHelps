# Judea #

## Facts: ##

The term "Judea" refers to an area of land in ancient Israel. It is sometimes used in a narrow sense and other times in a broader sense.

 * Sometimes "Judea" is used in a narrow sense to refer only to the province located in the southern part of ancient Israel just west of the Dead Sea. Some translations call this province "Judah."
 * Other times "Judea" has a broader sense and refers to all the provinces of ancient Israel, including Galilee, Samaria, Perea, Idumea and Judea (Judah).
 * If translators want to make the distinction clear, the broader sense of Judea (ex. Luke 1:5) could be translated as "Judea Country" and the narrow sense (ex. Luke 1:39) could be translated as "Judea Province" or "Judah Province" since this is the part of the land of ancient Israel where the tribe of Judah had originally lived.
