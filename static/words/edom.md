# Edom, Edomite, Idumea #

## Facts: ##

Edom was another name for Esau. The region where he lived also became known as "Edom" and later, "Idumea." The "Edomites" were his descendants.

* The region of Edom changed locations over time. It was mostly located to the south of Israel and eventually extended into southern Judah.
* During New Testament times, Edom covered the southern half of the province of Judea. The Greeks called it "Idumea."
* The name "Edom" means "red," which may refer to the fact that Esau was covered with red hair when he was born. Or it may refer to the red lentil stew that Esau traded his birthright for.
* In the Old Testament, the country of Edom is often mentioned as an enemy of Israel.
* The entire book of Obadiah is about the destruction of Edom. Other Old Testament prophets also spoke negative prophecies against Edom.
