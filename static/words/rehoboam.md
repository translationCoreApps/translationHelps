# Rehoboam #

## Facts: ##

Rehoboam was one of the sons of King Solomon, and became the king of the nation of Israel after Solomon died.

* At the beginning of his reign, Rehoboam was severe with his people, so ten of the tribes of Israel rebelled against him and formed the "kingdom of Israel" in the north.
* Rehoboam continued as king of the southern kingdom of Judah which consisted of the two tribes, Judah and Benjamin.
* Rehoboam was a wicked king who did not obey Yahweh, but worshiped false gods.
