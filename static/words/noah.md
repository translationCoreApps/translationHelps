# Noah #

## Facts: ##

Noah was a man who lived over 4,000 years ago, at the time when God sent a worldwide flood to destroy all the evil people in the world. God told Noah to build a gigantic boat in which he and his family could live while the flood waters covered the earth.

* Noah was a righteous man who obeyed God in everything.
* When God told Noah how to build the gigantic boat, Noah built it exactly the way God told him to.
* Inside the boat, Noah and his family were kept safe and later their children and grandchildren filled the earth with people again.
* Everyone born since the time of the flood is a descendant of Noah.
