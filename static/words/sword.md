# sword #

## Definition: ##

A sword is a flat-bladed metal weapon used to cut or stab. It has a handle and a long, pointed blade with a very sharp cutting edge.

* The blade of a sword in ancient times was around 60 to 91 centimeters long.
* Some swords have two sharp edges and are called "double-edged" or "two-edged" swords.
* Jesus' disciples had swords they planned to use to defend themselves. With his sword, Peter cut off the ear of the high priest's servant.
* Both John the Baptist and the apostle James were beheaded with swords.

## Translation Suggestions ##

* A sword is used as a metaphor for God's word. God's teachings in the Bible expose people's innermost thoughts and convict them of their sin. In a similar way, a sword cuts deeply, causing pain. (See: [Metaphor](https://git.door43.org/Door43/en-ta-translate-vol1/src/master/content/figs_metaphor.md))
* One way to translate this figurative use would be, "God's word is like a sword, which cuts deeply and exposes sin."
* Another figurative use of this term is in the book of Psalms where the tongue or speech of a person is compared to a sword, which can injure people. This could be translated as, "the tongue is like a sword that can badly injure someone."
* If swords are not known in your culture, this word could be translated with the name of another long-bladed weapon that is used to cut or stab.
* A sword could also be described as a "sharp weapon" or "long knife." Some translations may decide to include a picture of a sword.
