# tradition #

## Definition: ##

The term "tradition" refers to customs and practices that have been kept over time and which are passed down to people in later generations.

* Often in the Bible the word "traditions" refers to teachings and practices that people made, not God's laws. The expression, "tradition of men" or "human tradition" makes this clear.
* Phrases such as "traditions of the elders" or "traditions of my fathers" refer specifically to Jewish customs and practices that Jewish leaders over time had added to the laws God gave to the Israelites through Moses. Even though these added traditions did not come from God, people thought they had to obey them in order to be righteous.
* The apostle Paul also uses the term "tradition" in a different way to refer to teachings about Christian practice that came from God and that he and other apostles had taught new believers.
* In modern times, there are many Christian traditions that are not taught in the Bible, but rather are the result of historically accepted customs and practices. These traditions should always be evaluated in light of what God teaches us in the Bible.
