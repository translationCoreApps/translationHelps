# Midian, Midianites #

Midian was a son of Abraham and his wife Keturah. It is also the name of a people group and region located in the northern Arabian Desert to the south of the land of Canaan. The people of that group were called "Midianites."

* When Moses first left Egypt, he went to the region of Midian where he met the daughters of Jethro and helped them water their flocks. Later Moses married one of Jethro's daughters.
* Joseph was taken to Egypt by a group of Midianite slave traders.
* Many years later the Midianites attacked and raided the Israelites in the land of Canaan. Gideon led the Israelites in defeating them.
* Many of the modern-day Arabian tribes are descendants of this group.
