## Definition: ##

The term "cypress" refers to a kind of fir tree that was plentiful in the regions where people lived in Bible times, especially countries bordering the Mediterranean Sea.

* Cyprus and Lebanon are two places that are specifically mentioned in the Bible as having many cypress trees.
* The wood that Noah used to build the ark may have been cypress.
* Because cypress wood is sturdy and long-lasting, it was used by ancient peoples for building boats and other structures.
