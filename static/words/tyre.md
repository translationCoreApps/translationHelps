# Tyre, Tyrians #

## Facts: ##

Tyre was an ancient Canaanite city located on the coast of the Mediterranean Sea, in a region that is now part of the modern-day country of Lebanon. Its people were called "Tyrians."

* Part of the city was also located on an island in the sea, about one kilometer from the coast.
* Because of its location and valuable natural resources such as cedar trees, Tyre had a prosperous trading industry and was very wealthy.
* King Hiram of Tyre sent wood from cedar trees and skilled laborers for building a palace for King David.
* Years later, Hiram also gave King Solomon wood and skilled laborers for building the temple. Solomon paid him with large amounts of wheat and olive oil.
* Tyre was often associated with the nearby ancient city of Sidon. These were the most important cities of the region of Canaan called Phoenicia.
