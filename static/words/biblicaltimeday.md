# day #

## Definition: ##

The term "day" literally refers to a period of time lasting 24 hours beginning at sundown. It is also used figuratively.

* For the Israelites and the Jews, a day began at sunset of one day and ended at sunset of the next day.
* Sometimes the term "day" is used figuratively to refer to a longer period of time, such as the "day of Yahweh" or "last days."
* Some languages will use a different expression to translate these figurative uses or will translate "day" nonfiguratively.
* Other translations of "day" could include, "time" or "season" or "occasion" or "event," depending on the context.
