# pig, swine, pork #

## Definition: ##

A pig is a type of four-legged, hoofed animal that is raised for meat. Its meat is called "pork." The general term for pigs and related animals is "swine."

 * God told the Israelites not to eat pig meat and to consider it unclean. Jews today still view pigs as unclean and do not eat pork.
 * Pigs are raised on farms to be sold to other people for their meat.
 * There is a kind of swine that is not raised on farms but rather lives out in the wild; it is called a "wild boar." Wild boars have tusks and are considered to be very dangerous animals.
 * Sometimes large pigs are referred to as "hogs."
